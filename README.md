At the **Economics Observatory** we believe that the future of effective science communication is a blend of data and text. Dashboards without context are too cluttered and text without explanatory graphics is difficult to grasp. Therefore, we have partnered with educators from leading institutions across teh country to be able to offer masterclasses in [Writing](/tree/main/writing) and [Data](/tree/main/data).

## 🌌 Visualisations

Head over to our **[ECOvisualisations](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ecovisualisations)** repository for all of our charts sorted by article. We try to follow industry best-practices in data visualisation and try to establish our very own visualisation guidelines for all chart types. You can read about these, as well as the tools we use in [**📐visualisation guidelines**](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ECOvisualisations/tree/main/guidelines).  

## 📊 Data

All of our chart data are published under their respective article subfolders, but on top of that we also operate the **[ECOdataHUB](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ecodatahub)**, where you will find a trove of data used in our articles and analyses, as well as interactive visualisation exploration interfaces. Whenever possible, we try to follow a [TIDY](http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf) format. You can read about our data zen in [**📐data guidelines**](https://github.com/EconomicsObservatory/ECOdataHUB/tree/main/guidelines).
